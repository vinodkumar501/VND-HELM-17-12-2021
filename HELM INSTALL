Helm is a package manager for k8s --> like yum , apt-get , npm , windows installer
all these can take package or s/w need to install as parameter they do install , if upgrade and unistall 

install
upgrade
uninstall

Helm work with charts 
charts are like packages --> these all have templates and configuration required to create k8s resources
single command to pull configurations 

takes all from charts and deploy in k8s
---> helm install apache bitnami/apache --namespace=web               #bitnami/apache  --> bitnami repo
Pulls charts and take all templates and values inside of it and create resources 
send those resource files to k8s to create k8s resources under namespaces

If latest version of apache available use
---> helm upgrade apache bitnami/apache --namespace=web

=========================================== Commands ==========================================
helm install apache bitnami/apache --namespace=web
helm upgrade apache bitnami/apache --namespace=web
helm rollback apache1 --namespace=web
helm uninstall apache

======================================== ADVANTAGES AFTER HELM =============================

Simplifies k8s deployment process by abstracting out all complexity

If you want to deploy monog db in k8s 
-> you have to write deployment , svc, configmap ,secret all then do deploy in k8s

but in helm you can do it in one command --> it takes all from chartrepo and deploy in to cluster directly
(mongo charts --> has all changes --> create by experts)

2. REVISION HISTORY
Helm maintains revision history ( after each upgrade ) --> easily rever
helm  upgrade apache bitnami/apache

3.DYNAMIC CONFIGURATION
by default in k8s yaml deployment,svc,configmap are static files not ask any parameters dynamically it repeat across all in pjcts.
helm gives all as templates and provide placeholders to pass parameters to dynamic values( values.yml)
templates and values.yml

4.CONSISTENCY
if we need to upgrade or install you dont need to update files just need to hit 

helm upgrade apache bitnami/apache --namespace=web

can alway be sure we hit locally and what we deploy in cluster

5.INTELLIGENT DEPLOYMENT
If you have in k8s yaml 
deploy.yml configmap.yml  secret.yml svc.yml 
it deploys as line in k8s yaml file specified in folder 1 by 1

but Helm will check and deploy required resources like dependencies first it deploy then do others
it knows order in which k8s resources wiil created, it automatically do that

like 
configmap.yml  secret.yml deploy.yml  svc.yml

6.SECURITY:
charts downloaded in repo are secured 
chars can signed by cryptography and hashes
